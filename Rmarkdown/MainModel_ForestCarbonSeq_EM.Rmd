### Pulling submodels together

####Beetle: Logistic model
```{r}
source("../R/SubModel1_BarkBeetles.R")

t=100

beetles = as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = t,ncol = 2))
colnames(beetles) = c("time","pop")
beetles[,1] = seq(1:t)

r = 0.3
K = 10000
N_0 = 500

for(i in 2:t){
  beetles[1,2] = N_0
  beetles[i,2] = beetle_pop(beetles$pop[i-1],r=r,K=K)
}

plot(beetles$time,beetles$pop)
```

####Pine: Growth... model
```{r}

#Emma's making pine model w/ matrix

```

####Climate dataframes
```{r}

#temp_BAU = increase of 10 degrees over 80 yrs
#temp <0C = pine beetle babies killed

BAU_temp_summer = rnorm(n = 80, mean = 70, sd = 5)
BAU_temp_winter = rnorm(n = 80, mean = )
BAU_precip_BAU = rnorm(n = 80, mean = 20, sd = 5)

```
